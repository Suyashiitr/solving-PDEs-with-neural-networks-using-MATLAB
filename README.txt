There is 1 folder and 1 file in the zip file along with this README file
The folder contains all the code written to implement the project. It has 6 MATLAB files.
The description is as follows :
Project CHN 323 Group 9.pdf
This file contains the paper. The summary, equations, results. All our work summed up in a single PDF file.

In the ‘code’ folder :
waveeq_plot.m
The MATLAB code for plotting the wave equation as function of space keeping the time fixed.
Waveeq.m
The MATLAB neural network implementation of wave equation study. On running it, a MATLAB window will be opened and will run for a few epochs (less than 1000) and train the neural networks. It will then predict the values of u for all values of x given keeping t fixed. It will then show a plot of u vs x for a value of t.
kdv.m
The MATLAB neural network implementation of K-dV equations study. On running it, a MATLAB window will be opened and will run for a few epochs (less than 1000) and train the neural networks. It will then predict the values of u for all values of x given keeping t fixed. It will then show a plot of u vs x for a value of t.
kdv_burgers.m
The MATLAB neural network implementation of K-dV Burgers equations study. On running it, a MATLAB window will be opened and will run for a few epochs (less than 1000) and train the neural networks. It will then predict the values of u for all values of x given keeping t fixed. It will then show a plot of u vs x for a value of t.
graph_kdv.m
The MATLAB code for plotting the K-dV equation as function of space keeping the time fixed.
graph_kdvb.m
The MATLAB code for plotting the K-dV Burgers equation as function of space keeping the time fixed.
